\section{Methods}

\subsection{Model Methods}
General process of how the guys created the model. What they chose as parameters, why they chose specific set-up/ structure etc. 
\begin{compactitem}
\item software used
\item Thought process, planning
\item architecture of model chosen and why 
\item how/why parameters were chosen 
\item optimization methods
\item 1-D model set up
\item 2-D model set up
\end{compactitem}

\subsection{Data Analysis Methods}



We decided to normalize the raw nursing home data by two different parameters in order to narrow the scope of focus and neutralize non-essential information from the data. We normalized the data sets belonging to the nursing home population in the United States by a vaccination parameter characteristic to the nursing home demographic (an internal pressure), and by an external pressure, which was either cases per un-vaccinated individual in the United States, or fatalities per un-vaccinated individual in the United States. The purpose in these normalization parameters is to refine the analysis to reflect the nursing home environment and gauge how the un-vaccinated population outside of the nursing homes have affected the nursing home case and fatality rates. This is comparison is essential for us to be able to draw an inference as to whether or not the medical professionals (aka nurses) who are employed at these respective nursing homes, play a role in the propagation of the virus within the homes, and if so, to what deadly degree?


Process and methods used to gather and then analyze the data. How we ruled out factors, how we ruled in factors, process of elimination etc. 
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Where is data from
	\item How we got it
	\item Pipeline analysis set-up
	\item types of plots generated
	\item Analysis after plots-- how we determined "significance" in event analysis
	\item What constitutes ruling in a parameter; ruling out a parameter 
	\item What constitutes a likely conclusion
\end{compactitem}

\subsection{Event Analysis Discussion}

The effectiveness of vaccinating the population against COVID-19 is undeniably positive, and is apparent through the decline in the presence of COVID-19 within the nursing home setting at the National, State, and County level. 

\vspace{5mm}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Nationwide has declined
	\item California \& Texas have declined; Florida residents remain constant-- weird.
	\item by the time 80-90\% of first dose has been delivered, everyone is at low levels for COVID-19 in nursing home
	\item health professionals are vectors
	\item vaccinating health professionals first, and earlier saves lives faster
	\item

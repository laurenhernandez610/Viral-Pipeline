\indent In figures 2-10, the 14 day moving average of daily new COVID-19 case count per day in 9 counties is displayed on a logarithmic scale ($log_{10}$) with vertical line overlays representing the dates when five sophisticated COVID-19 variant strains were first detected in their respective population. The counties assessed are Miami-Dade County, Florida; Broward County, Florida; Orange County, Florida; Los Angeles County, California; San Bernardino County, California; San Francisco County, California; Travis County, Texas; Dallas County, Texas; and Harris County, Texas. The genomic isolation dates of the COVID-19 variant strains in figures 2-10 are belonging to: CAL.20C (of lineage B.1.429), first isolated in California; B.1.1.207, first isolated in Nigeria; B.1.1.7 (aka VOC-202012/01, and as lineage B.1.1.7, or 20I/501Y.V1), first isolated in the United Kingdom; B.1.351 (aka 20H/501Y.V2, formerly known as 20C/501Y.V2), first isolated in South Africa; and P.1 (of lineage B.1.1.248), first isolated in Tokyo, and colloquially referred to as the Brazilian variant. 

 \indent Prior to the overlay of the first prominent COVID-19 variant displayed in each figure, 100\% of the counties are increasing in daily new COVID-19 cases per day. In 88.9\% of the counties, CAL.20C is overlayed an increasing slope representing the change in daily new COVID-19 cases per day. Specifically, San Francisco County in California, which was undergoing an exponential rate of change in daily new COVID-19 cases per day when CAL.20C was first detected. It's possible that CAL.20C may have been circulating in the population undetected for an unknown period of time prior to genomic sequencing.
 
 \indent After the Nigerian COVID-19 variant, B.1.1.207 is isolated, 66.7\% of the counties are displaying a steady decline in daily new COVID-19 cases per day, 11.1\% of the counties display a shallow local minimum in cases after the detection of variant B.1.1.207, and 22.2\% of the counties display an increase in daily new COVID-19 cases per day after the detection of B.1.1.207, followed by a decline in the rate of daily new COVID-19 cases per day. Due to the absence of a coherent response among the counties in regards to the isolation of the Nigerian COVID-19 variant, B.1.1.207, it's possible that this variant has had marginal impact on the rate of daily new COVID-19 cases per day in these respective counties.
 
 \indent When the isolation date of the UK COVID-19 variant, B.1.1.7, occurs, 55.6\% of the counties are experiencing a local minimum in daily new COVID-19 cases per day, 22.2\% of the counties are amidst a decline in daily new COVID-19 cases per day, 11.1\% of the counties are at a local maximum, and 11.1\% of the counties are at the base of a steep rise in daily new COVID-19 cases per day; however, 100\% of the counties display a perpetual increase in daily new COVID-19 cases per day either the day of, or shortly after the isolation date of the COVID-19 variant B.1.1.7.
 
 \indent The genomic isolation date of the South African variant, B.1.351, occurs just before the sequencing date of the Brazilian COVID-19 variant, P.1. As both variants are identified, 100\% of the counties are amidst their greatest daily reportings for daily new COVID-19 cases per day and 100\% of the counties continue reporting staggeringly high daily new COVID-19 cases per day. After the arrival of both B.1.351 and P.1. 100\% of the counties are reporting daily record-breaking values in new COVID-19 cases per day for their respective population. It's inconclusive as to the implication of B.1.351 and P.1 on the aforementioned counties, as 100\% of the counties are already experience a surge in daily new COVID-19 cases when B.1.351 and P.1 are identified.

\indent In figures 22-30, the 14 day moving average of daily new COVID-19 fatalities per day in 9 counties is displayed on a logarithmic scale ($log_{10}$) with vertical line overlays representing the dates in which five sophisticated COVID-19 variant strains were first detected in their respective population. The counties assessed are Miami-Dade County, Florida; Broward County, Florida; Orange County, Florida; Los Angeles County, California; San Bernardino County, California; San Francisco County, California; Travis County, Texas; Dallas County, Texas; and Harris County, Texas. The genomic isolation dates of the COVID-19 variant strains in figures 22-30 are belonging to: CAL.20C (of lineage B.1.429), first isolated in California; B.1.1.207, first isolated in Nigeria; B.1.1.7 (aka VOC-202012/01, and as lineage B.1.1.7, or 20I/501Y.V1), first isolated in the United Kingdom; B.1.351 (aka 20H/501Y.V2, formerly known as 20C/501Y.V2), first isolated in South Africa; and P.1 (of lineage B.1.1.248), first isolated in Tokyo, and colloquially referred to as the Brazilian variant.

\indent When CAL.20C is genetically isolated in California, 77.8\% of the counties assessed in the study are on the rising end of a local maximum in daily new COVID-19 fatalities per day. Additionally, in 77.8\% of the counties, the isolation date of CAL.20C coincides with the most deadly time of the pandemic for the respective counties. At this date, the counties at hand are undergoing the highest rate in daily new COVID-19 fatalities per day since daily COVID-19 reporting was initiated. In 11.1\% of the counties, daily new COVID-19 fatalities are at the brink of a new, local maximum when CAL.20C is isolated. Further, in 11.2\% of the counties, CAL.20C coincides with extremely low reportings for daily new COVID-19 fatalities in which the isolation date is overlaid a non-existent plot, as reportings are so low. 

\indent As the variant strain from Nigeria, also known as B.1.1.207, is first isolated, 66.7\% of the counties are on the downhill trek of a local maximum in daily new COVID-19 fatalities per day. Conversely, in 22.2\% of the counties, the isolation date of B.1.1.207 coincides with the peak of a local maximum in daily new COVID-19 fataities per day. Additionally, in 11.2\% of the counties, reporting of daily new COVID-19 fatalities are so low that the isolation date of B.1.1.207 is overlaid a non-existent plot. 

\indent When the variant strain from the United Kingdom, also referred to as B.1.1.7, is isolated, 77.8\% of the counties are displaying a local minimum in daily new COVID-19 fatalities per day. In 11.1\% of the counties, namely San Francisco County, reportings for daily new COVID-19 cases per day are so low that the isolation date overlay for B.1.1.7 occurs prior to the availability of significant data. Further, in 11.2\% of the counties, the isolation of B.1.1.7 occurs during a local maximum in daily new COVID-19 fatalities per day. 

\indent The genetic sequencing of COVID-19 variants B.1.351 and P.1 (associated with South Africa and Tokyo, respectively), occur relatively close in time to one another. At the time in which these two variant strains are isolated, 33.4\% of the counties are displaying a rapid drop towards single integer values in daily new COVID-19 fatalities. In 66.7\% of the counties, the isolation date of B.1.351 and P.1 coincide with a local maximum in daily new COVID-19 fatalities.

In figures XX-XX, the 14 day moving average of daily new COVID-19 fatalities per day in 9 counties is displayed on a logarithmic scale ($log_{10}$) with vertical line overlays representing the dates in which local and state mask order dates were initiated. The counties assessed are Miami-Dade County, Florida; Broward County, Florida; Orange County, Florida; Los Angeles County, California; San Bernardino County, California; San Francisco County, California; Travis County, Texas; Dallas County, Texas; and Harris County, Texas. The genomic isolation dates of the COVID-19 variant strains in figures 22-30 are belonging to: CAL.20C (of lineage B.1.429), first isolated in California; B.1.1.207, first isolated in Nigeria; B.1.1.7 (aka VOC-202012/01, and as lineage B.1.1.7, or 20I/501Y.V1), first isolated in the United Kingdom; B.1.351 (aka 20H/501Y.V2, formerly known as 20C/501Y.V2), first isolated in South Africa; and P.1 (of lineage B.1.1.248), first isolated in Tokyo, and colloquially referred to as the Brazilian variant.
